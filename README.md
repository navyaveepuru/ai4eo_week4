This code classifies the echoes in leads and sea ice and produces an average echo shape as well as standard deviation for these two classes. 
It plots 100 echoes using a K means clustering model and then a gaussian mixture model for clustering. The peak values for these two clustering methods are then compared using a box and whisker plot.
The echo classification is then compared against the ESA official classification using a confusion matrix.
